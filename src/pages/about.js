      	Metacognition is a podcast which celebrates the  boundless frontiers of human thought and achievement and features those who live and work on the bleeding edge of modernity. Today, our assumptions about the way the world works break down in our increasingly networked, information-driven, and often chaotic global society. The guests we will bring to you on this podcast will challenge us to plunge courageously into this unfamiliar territory with the unprecedented degree of sophisticated and critical thought this realm demands. Here, you will get an intimate window into the lives and minds of the thought leaders, the trailblazers, the visionaries,  those who define our changing lives with their ingenuity, perspicacity, and grit.
