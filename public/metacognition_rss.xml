    <title>MacGuire and Austen 0: Vagrant Valor</title>
    <itunes:author>jhoseph88</itunes:author>
    <itunes:subtitle>Tobin MacGuire and Jonathan Austen were two of the central figures in the vagabond insurrection of 2048 which ousted the nearly three-centuries of constitutional Republican rule over the vast country formerly known as the United States of America. You will hear the two discuss, after over a decade of estrangement, their shared philosophies which catalyzed their legendary coup. You'll notice that their contrasting lifestyles reflect a major epistemological rift which undergirds the existing two-party system they helped bring about. Both homeless, Tobin is an Originalist who prefers to maintain the lifestyle that defined the streets of early twenty-first century America. Jonathan, however exists on the periphery, now residing in a posh hotel baring the gnarled and rusted namesake of the lame duck empire they helped usurp: Trump. Despite their different ways of living, I think you'll find that Tobin and Jonathan, through reminiscing on their humble beginnings, the value of human relationships, convenience store nutrition, and much more, rediscover a mythological rapport which shaped American history forever.</itunes:subtitle>

    <title>Papa Bluey: Hula Hoop Legend</title>
    <itunes:author>jhoseph88</itunes:author>
    <itunes:subtitle>Papa Bluey is a pioneering hula hoop practitioner who has worked tirelessly for decades to transmute his discipline from a club drug-tarnished province of Middle America's working class to a high art finding its place on the tongues of the East Coast intelligentsia and the West Coast billionaire technocracy. In our effort to contextualize the man in a sociocultural, psychoeconomic metaphysic, we sent our very own Jabron E. to interview Bluey in his native town of Indianapolis, the hearth of hula hooping culture as such. In their lengthy discussion, Bluey walks Jabron through topics ranging from the circus-to-competitive-hula-hoop pipeline, celebrity's role in culinary entrepreneurship, the digital body art phenomenon, and the QR code fashion revolution. Papa Bluey was beyond generous with his time and creative energy, and he has conferred upon us the singular honor of previewing the soundtrack to the solo routine he is set to debut Krakow this coming May. You'll hear this groundbreaking playlist in the background of the podcast as Bluey graciously streams it from his MP3 tattoo, courtesy of Ray Cool . Adulation and awe notwithstanding, I think you'll find the famously hermetic artist wields a disarming and charitably inspirational voice, one which we welcome in these uncertain times.</itunes:subtitle>

    <title>Richard Front: Province 48</title>
    <itunes:author>jhoseph88</itunes:author>
    <itunes:subtitle>When famed entrepreneur, Richard Front, initially approached us with the intent of promoting his groundbreaking new book, Why You Will Not Be an Elite: Secrets of the Province 48 Machine Learning Algorithm, it broke our hearts to have to turn him away. At this time, we had run out of funding and many of our staff had left in a rout of consternation and chagrin. Well-aware of our audience and their admiration for his work, Richard, also a long-time Metacognition listener, gave us a generous gift of a sum we cannot disclose publicly. The consequence of this unprecedented act of philanthropy is that, today, we get to bring you a rare, intimate interview with the genius himself, Mr. Richard Front. In a protracted conversation with James "Jim" Alvarez, one of our freelance executive producers, Richard graciously promotes his aforementioned book and shares his fascinating life story which, as many of us know, led to his current project, Province 48. In a word, Province 48 is a mentorship program and study space which uses cutting edge technology to catapult the world's most promising university students to leadership positions in the dynamic global economy the Province helps these students understand and prepare for. Richard has been known to call this program an "elite generation accelerator."" The backbone of this organization is the machine learning algorithm Richard describes in his new book, again, Why You Will Not Be an Elite: Secrets of the Province 48 Machine Learning Algorithm. This algorithm dictates the way Province 48 is run, thereby insulating the organization from human bias and the intellectual fallacies future elites must learn to overcome. In this episode, you'll hear Richard and Jim discuss Why You Will Not Be an Elite: Secrets of the Province 48 Machine Learning Algorithm,  Richard's benevolent, humble beginnings selling untested pharmaceutical products to underprivileged communities, how the government's sanctioning of cocaine stymies human progress, the righteousness and efficiency of lowering your career ambitions to your inherited social stratum, and many more topics we think you'll find intriguing and, if you're anything like me, life-changing.</itunes:subtitle>
